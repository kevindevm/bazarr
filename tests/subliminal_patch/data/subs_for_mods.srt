1
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:38,992
D'oh!

2
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,044
Stupid junk mail.

3
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:00,591
Yeah. Win this.

4
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:04,525
I'll see that he gets it.

5
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:07,963
How dumb do they think I am?
Huh? A check?

6
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:11,560
One million dollars.

7
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:16,131
I'm rich!

8
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:21,803
Mr. Simpson, I can assure you,
this check of yours is nonnegotiable.

9
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,372
Oh, yeah?
Well, what makes you so damn sure?

10
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:28,249
See where it says "Void, void, void"
and "This is not a check"?

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,686
"Cash value
1 /20th of a cent."

12
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:32,724
- " Mr. Banker, do not honor."
- Shut up.

13
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,056
I had a feeling it was
too good to be true.

14
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:39,495
Every time you get a million dollars,
something queers the deal.

15
00:01:39,565 --> 00:01:42,432
I don't think real checks
have exclamation points.

16
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:44,992
Well, at least we got
a free sample of Reading Digest.

17
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,006
Marge, I never read
a magazine in my life,
and I'm not gonna start now.

18
00:01:49,074 --> 00:01:51,099
Hey, a cartoon!

19
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,838
Ain't it the truth?

20
00:01:56,915 --> 00:01:58,644
No, it's not the truth, Homer.

21
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:01,652
It's well-documented that women
are safer drivers than men.

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,883
Oh, Marge, cartoons
don't have any deep meaning.

23
00:02:04,957 --> 00:02:07,425
They're just stupid drawings
that give you a cheap laugh.

24
00:02:10,496 --> 00:02:12,430
Hey, Einstein,
put down your reading.

25
00:02:12,498 --> 00:02:14,022
- It's lunchtime.
- You go ahead.

26
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:16,659
Hey, you don't wanna eat?
What you do, get one of them
stomach staples?

27
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,295
As Tolstoy said
in Quotable Notables...

28
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:22,932
"Give me learning, sir,
and you may keep your black bread."

29
00:02:23,008 --> 00:02:25,476
- Who is that bookworm, Smithers?
- Homer Simpson, sir.

30
00:02:25,544 --> 00:02:28,240
Simpson, eh?
How very strange.

31
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:31,441
His job description
clearly specifies an illiterate.

32
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:36,113
We now return to Troy McClure
and Delores Montenegro
in Preacher With a Shovel.

33
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:39,180
But Irrigation can save
your people, Chief Smiling Bear.

34
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:41,852
Marge, look at them
staring at that idiot box.

35
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:45,055
God forbid they would
ever read something
and improve their minds.

36
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:47,428
You've certainly taken
a shine to that magazine.

37
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:49,865
It's not just
one magazine, Marge.

38
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:53,530
They take hundreds of magazines,
filter out the crap...

39
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:57,166
and leave you with something
that fits right in your front pocket.

40
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:03,810
God! Those kids don't know
what they're missing.

41
00:03:05,784 --> 00:03:07,979
- Dad!
- Hey, what gives, man?

42
00:03:08,053 --> 00:03:09,987
the House of Representatives
on C-SPAN,

43
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:13,286
and listen to an inspiring story
of wilderness survival.

44
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:15,485
"Then I heard the sound...

45
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:17,893
"that all
arctic explorers dread—

46
00:03:17,963 --> 00:03:20,727
the pitiless bark
of the sea lion."

47
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,460
He'll be killed!

48
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:26,368
Homer, he obviously got out alive
if he wrote the article.

49
00:03:26,438 --> 00:03:30,101
Don't be so—
Oh, you're right.

50
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,606
Homey, put down your magazine
for a minute.

51
00:03:37,683 --> 00:03:41,210
- Huh?
- I thought you might wanna snuggle.

52
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:46,383
That reminds me.
"Seven ways to spice up
your marriage."

53
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:50,394
Marge, "You have a nice body...

54
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:54,296
and if you'd like to
see me in a costume,
you have only to ask."

55
00:03:54,366 --> 00:03:55,958
Thank you, Homey.

56
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:59,663
Wow! Little meat loaf men!

57
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,738
Where did you get
the idea for this, Mom?

58
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:06,574
Where do you think?
This baby never steers
you wrong, and it was free!

59
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:09,136
- Free.
- It certainly has enriched our lives.

60
00:04:09,214 --> 00:04:13,014
Wow. "Win a trip
to Washington, D.C.

61
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,952
All expenses paid.
V.I.P. tour."

62
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:19,320
- Oh, it's for kids.
- Wait, Dad!

63
00:04:20,726 --> 00:04:23,695
An essay contest.
"Children under 12.

64
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:28,165
Three-hundred words,
fiercely pro-American."
Sounds interesting.

65
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:31,225
Bart, maybe this is something
you'd like to do too.

66
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:35,501
Mom, it's a nice thought,
but we both know that
this is the pony to bet on.

67
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:41,672
What would Ben Franklin say
if he were alive today?

68
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:44,477
He'd say, uh...

69
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,142
"Think of a better opening."

70
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:48,618
- How's it going, honey?
- Not very well.

71
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:52,054
Well, when I used to
get stuck like this,
I'd go for a bike ride.

72
00:04:52,124 --> 00:04:55,116
- Do kids go
on bike rides anymore?
- Yes!

73
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:58,754
I don't know.
I thought maybe bikes
weren't cool anymore.

74
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,028
- Do kids still use that word "cool"?
- Yes, Mom!

75
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:14,376
Okay, America, inspire me.

76
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:19,146
Wow, a bald eagle.

77
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,611
Hmm.

78
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,749
Thanks for driving me
to the contest, Dad.

79
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,988
Sweetheart, there's nothing
I wouldn't do for that magazine.

80
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:33,998
"So burn the flag if you must,
but before you do...

81
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:36,159

00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:38,532

and your pants.

00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,970
" Be sure to burn

84
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,405

85
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:47,377
"because none of those things
could exist without six white stripes...

86
00:05:47,446 --> 00:05:51,041
seven red stripes
and a hell of a lot of stars."

87
00:05:51,116 --> 00:05:52,811
Thank you very much.

88
00:05:52,884 --> 00:05:55,614
Yeah! Damn right!

89
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:03,559

Thank you.

105
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:05,023
- What do you think?
- It's good.

106
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,990
A little too good
for an eight-year-old.

Mr. Simpson, I'd like to
ask you a few questions
about your daughter's essay.

109
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:18,827
- Lisa, will you excuse us?
- Okay.

110
00:07:18,904 --> 00:07:21,498
"We the purple"?
What the hell was that?

111
00:07:21,573 --> 00:07:24,303
- Are you a professional writer?
- Mm-mmm.

112
00:07:24,376 --> 00:07:26,435
Are you interested in
politics or government?

113
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,172
I don't know.

114
00:07:28,246 --> 00:07:31,807
- Are you interested in anything?
- I don't know.

115
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:35,250
- Could you touch your nose for me? Hmm.
- Mm. Hmm.

116
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:40,184
Lisa, after meeting
your father...

117
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:42,886
I've decided to award you
an additional five points.

118
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:46,556
Congratulations.
You and your family
are going to Washington.

119
00:07:46,631 --> 00:07:48,963
Wa-hoo!
Who would have guessed...

120
00:07:49,034 --> 00:07:52,165
reading and writing
would pay off?

121
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:04,100
- Yes, sir, can I get you something?
- Playing cards, notepad...

122
00:08:04,177 --> 00:08:06,611
aspirin, sewing kit,
pilot's wing pin...

123
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,977
propeller-shaped swizzle stick,
sleeping mask...

124
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:12,245
- and anything else
I've got coming to me.
- I'll see what I can do.

125
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:15,287
Hmm.

126
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:18,619
Steward!

127
00:08:18,691 --> 00:08:21,683
Little boy, I bet you'd like to
visit the cockpit.

128
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,285
Ooh-ooh, baby!

129
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:26,798
And this control stick is like
the handlebars on your tricycle.

130
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,959
Now, would you
like to see where
we hang our coats?

131
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,799
No, thank you.
I'd rather push
this button. Oops!

132
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:34,101
No!

133
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:36,869
We're all gonna die!

134
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:45,481
Look, Marge, that guy has
the same last name we do. Taxi.!

135
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:49,753
Oh, look, Homer,
the I.R.S.

136
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:53,485
- Boo!
- Oh, boo yourself.

137
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:57,154
Here we are, kids.
The Watergate.

138
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,674
Hey!

139
00:09:09,742 --> 00:09:13,303
Homer, look.!
They give you a shower cap...

140
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:16,678
and body gel
and bathrobes.

141
00:09:16,749 --> 00:09:19,547
And a welcoming mint
on your pillow.

142
00:09:19,619 --> 00:09:23,521
Wow, a shoehorn.
Just like in the movies.

143
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,787
Shoe goes on, shoe goes off,
shoe goes on, shoe goes off.

144
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,124
Shoe goes on,
shoe goes off.

145
00:09:30,196 --> 00:09:32,130
Hey, I call first bedsies.

146
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:35,690
Bart, there's no such thing
as first bedsies.
You just made that up.

147
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:37,702
Well, okay,
which one do you want?

148
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,796
I... want... that one.

149
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:43,307
Really?
You want that one?

150
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:45,139
It's all yours.
Whatever you say.

151
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:47,543
- Why? What's wrong with it?
- Nothing.

152
00:09:47,613 --> 00:09:49,877
- Have a good night's sleep, Lisa.
- No, really, what?

153
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:51,883
- Nothing.
- What did you do to it?

154
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:54,317
- Nothing.
- Mom!

155
00:09:56,489 --> 00:10:00,255
What the— D'oh!
Stupid welcoming mint!

156
00:10:00,326 --> 00:10:03,591
- Hello?
- Good morning.
This is your wake-up call.

157
00:10:03,663 --> 00:10:06,029
Wake-up call?
It's 2:00 a.m.

158
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:08,032
Sorry, fatso.

159
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:14,229
Free food?

160
00:10:14,307 --> 00:10:18,903
Lisa, I'm Faith Crowley—
patriotism editor of Reading Digest.

161
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:20,912
Oh, I love your magazine.

162
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,278
My favorite section is
" How to Increase Your Word Power."

163
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:27,979
That thing is really,
really, really... good.

164
00:10:28,054 --> 00:10:32,388
Well, good.
Lisa, I'd like you to meet
some other finalists.

165
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:35,586
- This is Trong Van Dinh
and Maria Dominguez.
- Hello.

166
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:38,129
Maria is the National
Spelling Bee Champion.

167
00:10:38,197 --> 00:10:41,257
And Trong has won both
the Westinghouse Talent Search...

168
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:44,667
and the NFL Punt,
Pass and Kick Competition.

169
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:48,673
Have either of you ever run
into any problems because
of your superior ability?

170
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:52,268
- Hmm?
- Sure, I guess.
- Oh, me too!

171
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,807
These are special
V.I.P. badges.

172
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:57,906
They'll get you into places
other tourists never see.

173
00:10:57,984 --> 00:11:01,647
- Miss, what does the "I" stand for?
- Important.

174
00:11:01,721 --> 00:11:04,713
- Oh! How about the "V"?
- Very.

175
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,418
- Oh! And, miss,
just one more question.
- Person.

176
00:11:07,493 --> 00:11:09,427
Ah!

177
00:11:09,495 --> 00:11:11,759
- What does the "I" stand for again?
- Oh!

178
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:21,329
- "On this spot, Richard Nixon
bowled back-to-back 300 games."
- Yeah, right.

179
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:25,241
Wow, the president's bathroom.

180
00:11:28,614 --> 00:11:31,515
- Do you mind?
- Barbara Bush!

181
00:11:31,584 --> 00:11:34,417
Oh, you have
those damn badges.

182
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:39,083
Okay. This tub
was installed in 1894.

183
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,151
Mmm. Money.

184
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,856
Hey, watch it, chief.

185
00:11:47,933 --> 00:11:51,164
Folks, we print more than
18 million bills a day.

186
00:11:51,237 --> 00:11:53,762
Oh, and in case
you were wondering...

187
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,034
no, we don't give out
free samples.

188
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,044
Lousy, cheap country.

189
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:08,486
Bart, get out
of The Spirit of St. Louis.!

190
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:15,123
Hey, what's so funny.

191
00:12:15,194 --> 00:12:18,755
Oh, Marge, grow up!

192
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:23,325
Congressman, this is, uh,
Springfield National Forest.

193
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:27,133
- Now, basically, what we
wanna do is cut her down.
- Uh-huh.

194
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,834
As you can see
in our artist's rendition,
it's full of old growth...

195
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:31,968
just aging
and festering away.

196
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,740
In comes our logging company
to thin out the clutter.

197
00:12:34,814 --> 00:12:37,476
It's all part of nature's,
you know, cycle.

198
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,484
Well, Jerry, you're a whale
of a lobbyist, and, uh...

199
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:42,385
I'd like to give you a logging permit,
I would, but, uh...

200
00:12:42,455 --> 00:12:44,787
this isn't like
burying toxic waste.

201
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:47,325
People are gonna notice
those trees are gone.

202
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:50,995
Eh, Congressman, this is where
it gets awkward.

203
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:55,500
I— I never quite know
how to put this.

204
00:12:55,568 --> 00:12:57,502
- I just want to—
- Offer me a bribe?

205
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,541
Oh, what is it?

206
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:06,476
It's that little girl from Springfield
who wrote the essay.

207
00:13:06,545 --> 00:13:08,376
- Could be a good photo-op.
- Sure, fine.

208
00:13:08,447 --> 00:13:10,915
- So, uh, where do we—
- Duh, duh, duh, Not here.

209
00:13:10,983 --> 00:13:15,920
I've got a little place that
I use for these, uh, matters.
Call me tonight.

210
00:13:15,988 --> 00:13:20,220
- Well, hi there.
You must be Lisa Simpson.
- Hello, sir.

211
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:23,227
Lisa, you're a doer,
and who knows, maybe someday...

212
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:25,229
you'll be a congressman
or a senator.

213
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:27,026
We have quite a few
women senators, you know.

214
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:30,000
Only two. I checked.

215
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:32,731
You're a sharp one.
Well, how about a few pictures?

216
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,601
Tot shot always plays
in the sticks.

217
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:40,668
Oh, isn't that nice?

218
00:13:40,746 --> 00:13:42,680
Now there is
a politician who cares.

219
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:46,445
If I ever vote,
it'll be for him.

220
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:52,850
Mom?

221
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:55,621
Lisa, the contest
isn't for three hours.

222
00:13:55,694 --> 00:13:57,889
I'm too excited to sleep.

223
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,227
Anyone up for the
Winifred Beecher Howe Memorial?

224
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,859
- Who's that?
- An early crusader for women's rights.

225
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:05,961
She led the Floor Mop
Rebellion of 1 91 0.

226
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:09,132
Later, she appeared on
the highly unpopular
75-cent piece.

227
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:13,440
Okay, but you don't know
what you're missing.

228
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,680
Oh!

229
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:22,152
"I will iron your sheets
when you iron out...

230
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:24,348
the inequities
in your labor laws."

231
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:26,914
Amen, sister.

232
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,926
I told you
no one ever came here.

233
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:32,862
So, Bob, where do we stand
on Springfield Forest?

234
00:14:32,932 --> 00:14:35,696
Do I get my logging permit?

235
00:14:35,768 --> 00:14:39,704
Well, let me put it
this way, Jerry. Timber!

236
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,142
- What a pooch.
- Woof woof!

237
00:15:01,296 --> 00:15:05,665
How can I read my essay now?
I don't believe my own words.

238
00:15:09,738 --> 00:15:12,332
Honest Abe—
he'll show me the way.

239
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,708
- Mr. Lincoln—
- Mr. Lincoln,
I need your advice.

240
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:22,944
What can I do to make this
a better country?

241
00:15:23,018 --> 00:15:24,952
Is this a good time
to buy a house?

242
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,887
- I can't get my boy to brush.
- Would I look good
with a mustache?

243
00:15:27,956 --> 00:15:31,187
I tried using turpentine,
but that just made it worse.

244
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:36,189
Mr. Lincoln?
Mr. Lincoln?

245
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:40,224
My name is Lisa Simpson,
and I have a problem!

246
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:46,035
Mr. Jefferson,
my name is Lisa Simpson...

247
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:48,406
- and I have a problem.
- I know your problem.

248
00:15:48,477 --> 00:15:50,570
The Lincoln Memorial
was too crowded.

249
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:53,581
- Sorry, sir. It's just—
- No one ever comes to see me.

250
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:56,516
I don't blame them.
I never did anything important—

251
00:15:56,585 --> 00:15:58,576
just the Declaration
of Independence...

252
00:15:58,654 --> 00:16:01,145
the Louisiana Purchase,
the dumbwaiter—

253
00:16:01,223 --> 00:16:03,589
Maybe I should be going.
I caught you at a bad time.

254
00:16:03,659 --> 00:16:07,425
Wait! Please don't go.
I get so lonely.

255
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,149
The truth must be told.

256
00:16:35,491 --> 00:16:39,018
Oh.! Oh.! Oh.! Oh.!

257
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:41,722
Rudy, my man,
you're a miracle worker.

258
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:44,630
Your laundry, sir.

259
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,691
There you go.
Buy yourself something nice.

260
00:16:46,768 --> 00:16:50,761
- Thank you.
- Bart, are you ready to
go to—

261
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,864
- I'll room service you.!
- Before you kill me...

262
00:16:52,941 --> 00:16:55,341
remember, this trip
is all expenses paid.

263
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,025
- Thank you.
- Oh, this guy is awful.

264
00:17:15,097 --> 00:17:17,031
I know, honey,
but just sit still.

265
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,435
Welcome, everyone,
to the awards luncheon.

266
00:17:21,503 --> 00:17:24,165
I'd like to introduce
our distinguished judges...

267
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:26,298
who will select
our scholarship winner.

268
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:29,708
Former Redskins great
Alonzo Flowers...

269
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:32,770
perennial third-party candidate
Wilson DeFarge...

270
00:17:32,848 --> 00:17:35,146
Senate page Brad Fletcher...

271
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:37,447
skin care consultant Rowena...

272
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,216
and wealthy gadabout
Chilton Gaines.

273
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,386
Our first essayist
will be Lisa Simpson.

274
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,952
Lisa? Lisa?

275
00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:53,058
Oh, there she is.

276
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:55,831
Lisa Simpson
will now read her essay—

277
00:17:55,904 --> 00:17:58,896
I would like to read
a different essay, if I may?

278
00:17:58,974 --> 00:18:01,204
Um— Okay.

279
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:06,439
The city of Washington was built
on a stagnant swamp...

280
00:18:06,515 --> 00:18:10,474
some 200 years ago
and very little has changed.

281
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:13,544
It stank then
and it stinks now.

282
00:18:13,622 --> 00:18:17,786
Only today, it is
the fetid stench of corruption
that hangs in the air.

283
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:20,521
Cool! A ruckus.

284
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:25,962
And who did I see
taking a bribe...

285
00:18:26,034 --> 00:18:28,525
but the honorable
Bob Arnold.

286
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:31,072
But don't worry, Congressman...

287
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:35,269
I'm sure you can buy
all the votes you need
with your dirty money.

288
00:18:35,344 --> 00:18:39,110
And this will be one nation
under the dollar...

289
00:18:39,181 --> 00:18:42,514
with liberty
and justice for none.

290
00:18:47,656 --> 00:18:50,056
Senator, there's a problem
at the essay contest.

291
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,559
- Please, son, I'm very busy.
- A little girl...

292
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:55,688
- is losing faith in democracy.
- Good Lord!

293
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:04,338
Congressman, we want to drill for
oil in Teddy Roosevelt's head.

294
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:07,842
Well— Teddy who?

295
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:10,537
Congressman...

296
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:12,546
you're under arrest.

297
00:19:16,518 --> 00:19:19,146
- You work fast.
- I work for Uncle Sam.

298
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,621
We will now vote
on the House bill 1022—

299
00:19:25,694 --> 00:19:27,525
the expulsion of Bob Arnold.

300
00:19:27,596 --> 00:19:31,555
Mr. Speaker, I'm all for the bill,
but shouldn't we tack on...

301
00:19:31,633 --> 00:19:34,397
- a pay raise for ourselves?
- No.!

302
00:19:38,073 --> 00:19:41,167
Okay, this should make
my bosses very happy.

303
00:19:41,243 --> 00:19:46,408
- Your bosses?
- Yep. All 250 million of them.

304
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:51,976
When my family arrived
in this country four months ago...

305
00:19:52,054 --> 00:19:54,887
we spoke no English
and had no money in our pockets.

306
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:59,086
Today, we own a nationwide chain
of wheel-balancing centers.

307
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:02,392
Where else but in America—
or possibly Canada—

308
00:20:02,464 --> 00:20:05,365
could our family find
such opportunity?

309
00:20:05,434 --> 00:20:08,096
That's why whenever I see
the stars and stripes...

310
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:12,197
I'll always be reminded
of that wonderful word "flag."

311
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:17,541
There will be a brief recess
while the judges tabulate their votes.

312
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:20,206
Lisa, what's
gotten into you?

313
00:20:20,282 --> 00:20:23,046
Yeah, your other speech
was a little more crowd pleasing.

314
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:27,885
I'm sorry, Dad.
I couldn't think of a nice way
to say America stinks.

315
00:20:27,956 --> 00:20:31,016
Extra! Extra!
Feds nab rotten rep.

316
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:33,027
Give me one of those.

317
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:37,191
"Imprisoned congressman
becomes born-again Christian. "

318
00:20:37,265 --> 00:20:41,031
I can't believe it.
The system works.

319
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:50,343
- He already sang this song.
- No, that was about the budget gap.

320
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:52,039
This is the trading gap.

321
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:55,882
And now
the moment of truth.

322
00:20:55,951 --> 00:21:00,684
Will the winning essay be
" Bubble on, O melting pot"?

323
00:21:00,756 --> 00:21:03,657
"Lift high your lamp,
Green Lady"?

324
00:21:03,725 --> 00:21:06,558
"USA, A-OK"?

325
00:21:06,628 --> 00:21:09,256
Or "Cesspool on the Potomac"?

326
00:21:09,331 --> 00:21:12,300
Cesspool! Cesspool! Cesspool!
Cesspool! Cesspool!

327
00:21:12,367 --> 00:21:14,801
And now the winner is...

328
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:18,101
" USA, A-OK,"
by Trong Van Dinh.

329
00:21:18,173 --> 00:21:20,403
D'oh!

330
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:26,239
Miss Crowley, thank you
for this oversized novelty check.

331
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:29,841
I would like share this honor
with all of my fellow essayists...

332
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:32,887
particularly
the courageous Lisa Simpson...

333
00:21:32,954 --> 00:21:35,149
whose inflammatory
rhetoric reminded us...

334
00:21:35,223 --> 00:21:38,715
that the price of freedom
is eternal vigilance.

335
00:21:38,794 --> 00:21:41,888
Give her the check!

336
00:21:41,963 --> 00:21:43,954
I was serious.

337
00:21:57,445 --> 00:21:59,913
- Ow.!
- Bart!

338
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:03,439
Lis, you taught me to stand up
for what I believe in.

339
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:54,646
Shh!
